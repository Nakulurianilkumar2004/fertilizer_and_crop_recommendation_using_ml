Kisan Services: A Smart Agriculture Assistance System
Project Overview
Kisan Services is a Streamlit-based web application designed to assist farmers with essential agricultural services. The platform provides soil testing insights, crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, and information on government schemes, aiming to enhance farming efficiency and productivity through machine learning models and data-driven insights.

Project Modules
1Ô∏è‚É£ Home
Introduces the importance of farming in India, challenges faced by farmers, and modern agricultural techniques.
Displays images and descriptions of farming methods like traditional, modern, and organic farming.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Soil Testing
Provides guidance on soil testing methods and how it impacts crop selection.
Includes YouTube tutorial links for better understanding.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Crop Recommendation System
Uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the best crop based on soil and climate parameters.
Takes Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall as inputs.
Recommends the most suitable crop from a predefined crop list.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fertilizer Recommendation System
Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to suggest the best fertilizer based on:
Soil type (Loamy, Sandy, Clayey, etc.)
Crop type (Rice, Wheat, Cotton, etc.)
Temperature, humidity, and nutrient content (NPK levels)
Provides the most effective fertilizer (Urea, DAP, 10-26-26, etc.) for optimal yield.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Farmers' Schemes
Offers details about Indian government schemes supporting farmers, such as:
PM-KISAN Scheme
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)
Rythu Bandhu Scheme
Kisan Credit Card (KCC)
Includes direct links to application websites and YouTube tutorials for easy access.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Bio-Organic Vermicompost
Educates farmers about vermicomposting as an eco-friendly fertilizer alternative.
Provides information on how to prepare and use vermicompost to improve soil fertility.
Features YouTube links for step-by-step guidance.
Technology Stack
‚úÖ Python (Streamlit for UI, NumPy & Pandas for data processing)
‚úÖ Machine Learning Models (Random Forest Classifier, Pickle for model storage)
‚úÖ Joblib & Pickle (For loading pre-trained models)
‚úÖ Google & YouTube Links (For external resources)
‚úÖ CSV & JSON Files (For storing additional data)

Future Enhancements
üîπ Integration with Real-Time Weather APIs for dynamic crop and fertilizer recommendations.
üîπ Mobile App Version to enhance accessibility for farmers in rural areas.
üîπ Multilingual Support to make the platform more inclusive.
üîπ Voice Assistance Feature for ease of use in vernacular languages.

Conclusion
The Kisan Services application aims to bridge the gap between farmers and technology, helping them make data-driven decisions for better agricultural productivity. By leveraging machine learning, government resources, and sustainable farming practices, this project aspires to empower the farming community for a better future. üöúüå±
